	      <h1>Arthur Morgan's Journal</h1>
	      <h3>Memories of an Outlaw </h3>
<p></p>
	      <p>Red Dead Redemption 2 is a very popular game, in part because of the impressive display of technical achievements which is a topic for an extensive conversation, however, I'd like to focus on a narrative mechanic of the game  -The Journal.</p>

	      <p>Throughout his journey, Arthur will fill its pages with his thoughts, and supplement them with pencil drawings which look pretty nice. While journals are not uncommon in story-driven games, they usually function as just a log. The game is not particularly "in your face" with the journal so it's easy to ignore at first, the first time I stopped to read through it I probably had played over 30 hours, to my surprise, the journal is very detailed and it can change from player to player based on their decisions.</p>

	      <p>The thing with the journal is that it doesn't only work as a log of events in Arthur's adventures, but it also tells you how he feels about them all. In videogames, it is very difficult not to have a dissonance in the narrative, especially in open world games which tend to have more freedom of choice, what I mean by this is that often there's a conflict between gameplay mechanics and the game's story, GTA IV is a good example, in which the protagonist, Niko Bellic, says he's in America escaping his violent life and wishes for a change, but in the game he'd be commiting murder and robbing at least one bank. </p>
	      <p>Arthur by himself is a well written character, but when you add the journal it further helps understand that he's an imperfect person who's often confused on what he should do or how he should feel.</p>

	      <p>Sometimes he would do things he doesn't want to do for reasons he doesn't entirely understand.  It's quite obvious to him when he's in a dire situation, but he usually just goes with the current because "that's his life". So in a way, he’s a video game character we can relate to, and it is the journal that makes it possible. It’s an innovation I hope other games will be copying for generations to come.</p>
